* Progettazione e Analisi di Algoritmi course notes
  This document is a container of all the exercises that I did during
  the course of Design and Analysis of Algorithms at University of
  Florence.  The professors that give the lectures are Donatella
  Merlini e Maria Cecilia Verri.

  All the document content is written using the Italian language.

** How to compile the document
   In order to compile the document is sufficient to run `make pdf` if
   the pdf output is desired, otherwise `make ps` if the postscript
   output is desired. Of course the previous commands have to be typed
   at the root of the project after cloned the git repository.  During
   my develop time I've used the full installation of the tex-live
   suite on a debian-powered system. It can be installed by running
   'apt-get install texlive-full'.
   
   However, inside 'compiled-versions' folder, there is an already
   compiled pdf which is the latest version that is at least
   presentable.
