    "# An introduction to SymPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This introductory document is an introduction to **SymPy**, a Python module which provides symbolic manipulation of mathematical object. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest, this document born as a support of my [homework][] to pass the exam :P therefore we will talk about  *generating functions* in algorithms analysis, mainly. This notebook isn't verbose from the theoretical point of view but it contains the necessary code to verify theoretical results seen during classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular we would like to give a tour of SymPy features and how we can apply them to solve some problems about facts studied in **PAA** course, thought by professors Donatella and Cecilia. They main goal of this document is to have an *hands on* approach: we will see how *Jupiter notebooks* can be created and how put stuff in them toward experimenting with SymPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give some references, we provide the [comprehensive][sympy-doc] documentation, which contains an updated and very doable [tutorial][sympy-tutorial]. As we will soon see, we can put textual content in this kind of document using [Markdown][markdown] syntax. For those new to Python and for further references see the official Python [tutorial][python-tutorial]. Alex Martelli, now at Google, has been and continue to be a [*very*][alex] active contributor, moreover next __april__ [PyCon] will be here in Florence, and Alex [will attend][alex-florence-pycon] ;)\n",

    "## Why SymPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoted from [here][why SymPy]:\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are many computer algebra systems out there. This Wikipedia article lists many of them. What makes SymPy a better choice than the alternatives?\n",
    "\n",
    ">First off, SymPy is completely free. It is open source, and licensed under the liberal BSD license, so you can modify the source code and even sell it if you want to. This contrasts with popular commercial systems like Maple or Mathematica that cost hundreds of dollars in licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Second, SymPy uses Python. Most computer algebra systems invent their own language. Not SymPy. SymPy is written entirely in Python, and is executed entirely in Python. This means that if you already know Python, it is much easier to get started with SymPy, because you already know the syntax (and if you don’t know Python, it is really easy to learn). We already know that Python is a well-designed, battle-tested language. The SymPy developers are confident in their abilities in writing mathematical software, but programming language design is a completely different thing. By reusing an existing language, we are able to focus on those things that matter: the mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Another computer algebra system, Sage also uses Python as its language. But Sage is large, with a download of over a gigabyte. An advantage of SymPy is that it is lightweight. In addition to being relatively small, it has no dependencies other than Python, so it can be used almost anywhere easily. Furthermore, the goals of Sage and the goals of SymPy are different. Sage aims to be a full featured system for mathematics, and aims to do so by compiling all the major open source mathematical systems together into one. When you call some function in Sage, such as integrate, it calls out to one of the open source packages that it includes. In fact, SymPy is included in Sage. SymPy on the other hand aims to be an independent system, with all the features implemented in SymPy itself.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A final important feature of SymPy is that it can be used as a library. Many computer algebra systems focus on being usable in interactive environments, but if you wish to automate or extend them, it is difficult to do. With SymPy, you can just as easily use it in an interactive Python environment or import it in your own Python application. SymPy also provides APIs to make it easy to extend it with your own custom functions.\n",
