This project contains my work for the course Progettazione di Algoritmi e 
Complessita' Computazione (Algorithm Design and Computational Complexity) given by
Pierluigi Crescenzi at University of Florence.

The document will contain all my notes, my exercises (the major part of the whole)
and some experiments with Common Lisp.

I'll try to do all the implementation using Common Lisp.

Bye
